/// Disabling navigation transitions on `Flutter web`
///
/// Navigation transitions occur when a user moves between pages,
/// and it can be a great way to let the user orient themselves in a mobile application.
/// However, for `web` applications, itâ€™s not something you would typically see.
/// For a perceived performance improvement, you can disable the page transition animation.
///
/// By default, [MaterialApp] uses page transitions for routing relevant to the platform
///
/// To override this behavior, you can create your own [PageTransitionsTheme] class.
/// To detect when the application runs on the web, use the kIsWeb constant.
///
/// If it is on the `web`, disable the transition by returning the `child`
///
